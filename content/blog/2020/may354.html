	<p>
		Today the Maintenance Release 1 of JSR 354 was tagged code complete on <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day">Star Wars Day</a>.<br>		
		Check the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/JavaMoney/projects/1">issues resolved by MR1</a> on GitHub.<br>
		We still have to clarify a few things like the PGP keys to use for Sonatype/MavenCentral, but within a couple of days we should also have them on Sonatype Nexus after we deployed them on <a href="https://dl.bintray.com/javamoney/maven/">Bintray</a>.
