	<h3>API Release 1.0.1</h3>

	<p>
		A small patch of JSR 354 API was released yesterday.<br>
		The major fix was building the Java 7 (BP) API with Java 7 instead of Java 8. To ensure there are no class version compatibility problems running API-BP and Moneta-BP under Java 7. This patch release 1.0.1 of JSR 354 was be made available on popular Maven repositories.<br>
		There are no structural API changes nor JavaDoc, etc. therefore no MR was necessary for this and jcp.org won't be updated. Check the MavenCentral status badge in the <a href="http://github.com/JavaMoney/jsr354-api">JSR 354 API</a> GitHub repository.<br>
