	<h3>XS2A</h3>

	<p>
		To support the EU directive <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive#Revised_Directive_on_Payment_Services_(PSD2)">PSD2</a> the <a
			href="https://www.berlin-group.org/">Berlin Group</a> initiative described and specified the process to implement PSD2 in an open and transparent manner.
	</p><p>
	<a href="https://www.adorsys.de/en/index.html">Adorsys</a>, a development consultancy specialized in the financial and insurance sector made an <a href="https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a">XS2A</a> blueprint and Java reference implementation of the Berlin Group specification available on GitHub.
	We created a <a href="https://github.com/JavaMoney/xs2a">fork</a> at JavaMoney and already contributed some improvements back to the upstream repository by Adorsys via PRs.  We expect to continue contributing and welcome other members of the JavaMoney community if they wish to participate.
