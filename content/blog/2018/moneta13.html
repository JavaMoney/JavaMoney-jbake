	<h3>RI Release 1.3</h3>

	<p>
		Friday the 13th happened again this year in July. And another Service Release of the JSR 354 RI was released today.<br>
		Partly because enough issues were fixed, partly because it's a nice date, especially for a release 1.3 ;-)<br>		
		Fixing some issues, for a complete list see  <a

	Thanks everyone who helped with this release.
