	<h3>Transfer Ballot</h3>

	<p>
		Today the Maintenance Lead <b>Transfer Ballot</b> for JSR 354 was unanimously approved by the JCP EC. Check out the <a
			href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=6153">results</a>.<br>
		We (the 3 Maintenance Leads approved by the ballot) plan to post a Maintenance Release 1 of JSR 354 (which will also be reviewed and voted on by the EC) before the end of the year. 
		Once the JCP EC Elections are over and the new or returning EC members resume duty.<br>
		Check the <a href="https://github.com/JavaMoney/jsr354-api/milestone/1">issues targeted for MR1</a> on GitHub and please let us know, if you feel anything you face could be missing.<br>

	Thanks everyone in the JCP EC, the PMO and Credit Suisse for allowing further progress of JSR 354 and the wider JavaMoney project.
