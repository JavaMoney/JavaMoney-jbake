	<h3>API Release 1.0.3</h3>

	<p>
		A new service release of JSR 354 API was released today.<br>
		The major improvement was embracing the Java 9 module system. As usual This patch release 1.0.3 of JSR 354 was be made available on popular Maven repositories.<br>
		There are no structural API changes nor JavaDoc, etc. therefore no MR was necessary for this and jcp.org won't be updated. Check the <a href="https://github.com/JavaMoney/jsr354-api/releases/tag/1.0.3">1.0.3</a> release tag.<br>
