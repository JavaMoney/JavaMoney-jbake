	          <p>JavaMoney is the new monetary API for the Java&trade; Platform as well as related projects and libraries.
	          Whereas the API (JSR 354) provides a portable and extendible API for handling of Money &amp; Currency
	          models, Moneta provides a production ready reference implementation.<br/>
	          The JavaMoney libraries add additional functionalities that were built on top of the API such as</p>
	          <ul>
	          <li>Currency conversion</li>
	          <li>Currency mapping and namespaces</li>
	          <li>Basic financial calculations</li>
	          <li>Extended formatting (usable for arbitrary types)</li>
	          <li>Region API, allowing to organize regions, countries and territories as a forest of region trees</li>
	          <li>Validity API, allowing to manage the validity of arbitrary data and relations related to time (history)</li>
	          </ul>
